    <h2>Novelists of the 19th century</h2>
    <h3>Jack London</h3>
    <p>"I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificient glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet." Said Jack 
      <br>  The iconic American novelist, short story writer, journalist and social activist, Jack London is best known for writing Call of the Wild (1903) and White Fang. 
      ohn Griffith Chaney (January 12, 1876 – November 22, 1916), better known as Jack London, was an American novelist, journalist and activist. A pioneer 
      of commercial fiction and American magazines, he was one of the first American authors to become an international celebrity and earn a large fortune from writing. 
      He was also an innovator in the genre that would later become known as science fiction. 
<br> London was part of the radical literary group "The Crowd" in San Francisco and a passionate advocate of animal rights, workers’ rights and socialism. London 
wrote several works dealing with these topics, such as his dystopian novel The Iron Heel, his non-fiction exposé The People of the Abyss, War of the Classes, and Before Adam.
<br>London was born near Third and Brannan Streets in San Francisco. The house burned down in the fire after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; the California Historical
 Society placed a plaque at the site in 1953. Although the family was working class, it was not as impoverished as London's later accounts claimed. London was largely self 
 educated. In 1885, London found and read Ouida's long Victorian novel Signal. He credited this as the seed of his literary success. In 1886, he went to the Oakland Public 
 Library and found a sympathetic librarian, Ina Coolbrith, who encouraged his learning. (She later became California's first poet laureate and an important figure in the 
 San Francisco literary community).
